This directory contains the following files:

- allheaders.h.gch which is a pre-compiled header file.
- libsclpshared.so which is a shared object file.
- parser.tab.h which contains the token names and codes generated by yacc.
- sclp which is the reference implementstion
- storetokens.hh contains the declaration of the function which you can call to store tokens and print them.
- test1.c is a simple test file.

You need to include all the header files in your script.

You can link the shared object file with lex.yy.c by using the command

g++ lex.yy.c -include allheaders.h -L. -Wl,-rpath=. lex.yy.c -o yoursclp -lsclpshared -lfl -ly 

I strongly recommend that you learn to use a Makefile (program make, try `man make') and put the commands in the Makefile.
